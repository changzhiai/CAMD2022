    "The energy calculated with DFT is the electronic energy at 0K. However, to model catalytic reactions we are usually intereseted in the energy landscape at finite temperature. In this exercise we will calculate the energy contributions from vibrations and see how they affect the splitting of N<sub>2</sub> on Ru.\n",

    "### Vibrational energy of the initial and final states\n",
    "a) Calculating vibrations requires tighter convergence than normal energy calculations. Therefore you should first take your already optimised initial and final state geometries from the NEB calculations and relax them further to `fmax=0.01eV/Ã…` with the QuasiNewton optimiser and an energy cutoff of 450eV. Converge the eigenstates to 1e-8. (Note that for other systems you might need even tighter convergence!)\n",

Use 4 displacements to fit the frequencies and the same calculator parameters as in a).\n",
